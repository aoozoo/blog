### Edits[Â¶](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/tutorials/blogs/basic/?h=draft#edits)

Sometimes, bloggers need to update a post. This might happen when you make a mistake or when something changes that you need to reflect in the post. To indicate you have edited a post, you can include an `updated` date in the page header.

Editing a post

Make a change to your first blog post, then add an edit date to the header:

```
---
date:
  created: 2023-12-31
  updated: 2024-01-02
---
```

The Metadata section of the blog post itself will contain the edit date, though the index page omits this detail by default.
